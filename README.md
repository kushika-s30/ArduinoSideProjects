## 1. Object Detector using Ultrasoninc Sensor HC-SR04 

This sketch uses Ultrasoninc Sensor HC-SR04 to find the distance of a given object and depending on the distance range, the LED glows. 

Distance Range:

0-15 : RED LED GLOWS

15-45 : BLUE LED GLOWS

45-60 : GREEN LED GLOWS

This sketch uses 1960 bytes (6%) of program storage space. Maximum is 32256 bytes. Global variables use 9 bytes (0%) of dynamic memory, leaving 2039 bytes for local variables. Maximum is 2048 bytes.
